# Adversarial Image
Program uses adversarial attack methods to prevent copyrighted text-image pair scraping by generative AI models. I drafted background knowledge to aid selection of the implemented attack methods (researched current software on the market (e.g. Nightshade), basics of how AI models function, and gradient-based training used in adversarial attacks). With group members, coded a program that successfully implemented Fast Gradient Sign Method and Projected Gradient Descent to create perturbations in images that cause AI models to misclassify the image while retaining the original look. 

Program is coded in Python and implements TensorFlow. Project was submitted as Final Project for Linear Algebra and Probability with Professor George Dragomir at Columbia University (MATH UN2015).

Full description in the program's Jupyter Notebook file.
